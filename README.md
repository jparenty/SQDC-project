# SQDC R shiny Dashboards

Those R shiny applications were build as part of a research project on the cannabis industry. The dashboards were built to allow the user to visualize SQDC's sales data in a intuitive and efficient way. R shiny was used in order to build dynamic and interactive interfaces (web application, SaaS). 
	- Store sales application -> navigate through the sales, product categories, suppliers, of a choosen store and compare them to another. 
	- Map application -> create groups of store to compare their performance.
Before creating those applications, I had to clean and transform the data into the approriate format. This was done in python using mainly Pandas library. 


# Data

The data is not available publicly. This repository is intended to showcase my skills to build R shiny web application, you will only find the code of the apps and some screenshots of the app running. 

# Run the app
You can still run the application with the cache data by making that the .Rdata file is located in the directory as the app before running it from Rstudio.
